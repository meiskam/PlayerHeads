# 4.x Branch
Same simple plugin, new improvements.


# Where's the Source!?
The main project here combines different code from branches, and does not have its own code, starting with v4.7.2.

For the code behind core plugin behavior and classes that can be used as an API, and for documentation, see the [**core** branch](https://github.com/meiskam/PlayerHeads/tree/core) of this repository.

Otherwise, you can check out the **-support** branches for any server-specific implementation code
